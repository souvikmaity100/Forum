                        <h4>Warn About Adult Content</h4>
                        <p>Some sites contain content that is not suitable for a general audience or for viewing while
                            at work. To avoid creating problems for anyone who is trying to help, please add NSFW to the
                            topic title of the post, as well as tag the post NSFW, as a warning if a site falls into
                            this category. Err on the side of caution. Some volunteers here work for banks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h5>Do not spam</h5>
                        <p>The forums are here for providing users with a venue to get help with problems. In light of
                            this, please refrain from using signatures, new topics, or responses to existing topics as a
                            venue to promote your own plugins, themes or services. Your Forum Foster.org profile provides
                            you the means to add a link to your own site if you so desire.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h5>Do Not Bump Posts</h5>
                        <p>Do not bump posts. Bumping a post to “the top” does not help a topic get noticed. The
                            volunteers who try to answer questions look for those without replies first. If someone
                            bumps a post, then it disappears from the ‘No Replies’ view.</p>

                        <p>We have a list of threads without replies. When a post is bumped, it becomes harder for it to
                            be discovered and reduces the chances of getting appropriate help. Some forum helpers use
                            that list to prioritize over other answered threads.</p>

                        <p>Moderators will delete bumps they find. This is in order to help posts get back into the No
                            Replies listing, where they are more likely to get an answer.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Do Not Offer to Pay for Help</h4>
                        <p>Any thread that offers any service for money can be closed at any time. We are not against
                            paid services but these forums are not the right place for them.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h5>Do Not Offer to Work For Hire</h5>
                        <p>Don’t offer to work for hire in replies on these forums. Help on the forums should be given
                            freely, as in beer.</p>

                        <p>We believe that people should be able to make a living based on Forum Foster, but the support
                            forums are not the appropriate place for that.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h5>Do Not Post About Commercial Products</h5>
                        <p>For support of commercial themes or plugins, go to the official support channel.</p>

                        <p>In order to be good stewards of the Forum Foster community, and encourage innovation and
                            progress, we feel it’s important to direct people to those official locations. Doing this
                            will provide the developer with the income they need to make Forum Foster awesome.</p>

                        <p>Forum volunteers are also not given access to commercial products, so they would not know why
                            a commercial theme or plugin is not working properly.</p>

                        <p>Ultimately, the vendors are responsible for supporting their commercial product.</p>

                        <p>If you are a vendor and observe someone asking questions about your paid plugin or theme,
                            please direct them towards your own support resources.</p>

                        <p>While support of commercial products is not permitted in the forums, reviews are permitted if
                            any of the following is true.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The plugin or theme author upsells on this site.</li>
                            <li>The plugin or theme itself links or has an option to upgrade to a commercial or “pro”
                                version.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>When a developer who is publishing a plugin or theme does that, that becomes part of the
                            user’s experience and is a valid subject for a review on this site.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h5>Do Not Create Multiple Accounts (Sockpuppets)</h5>
                        <p>Do not create multiple accounts, aka sockpuppets. Sockpuppetry is often used for nefarious reasons, and as such we ask that you simply don’t do it. If a sockpuppet account is identified, it will be banned immediately.</p>

                        <p><b>If you are plugin or theme developer only</b>, having separate personal and “business” accounts is acceptable for uploading code to the Forum Foster repo or for a very limited capacity of support of that plugin or theme. In that limited capacity that may not be consider to be sockpuppetry.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h5>The Bad Stuff…</h5>
                        <p>We need to keep the forums friendly, so, occasionally, topic content will be moderated. In severe cases, users may be blocked. This might mean anything from the light editing of some posts to complete removal of topics and deactivation of accounts. It should really go without saying, but the following are likely candidates for moderation or intervention</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not post email addresses, ask others to post their email or solicit contacting people off of the forums.</li>
                            <li>Do not post, offer, or ask for login information, even test IDs and test passwords.</li>
                            <li>Do not post simply to request feedback on your site.</li>
                            <li>Do not use a review for support.</li>
                            <li>Do not post another person’s private information (job, gender, living situation, location, etc).</li>
                            <li>Do not ask for any kind of access in order to provide support, not even for plugins or themes.</li>
                            <li>Do not harass or abuse people.</li>
                            <li>Do not contact people outside of Forum Foster.org for support or to respond to a post/review. This includes using contact forms on their websites, phone numbers, social media, or any other contact method.</li>
                            <li>Do not abuse the ‘Report this topic’ or ‘modlook’ system.</li>
                            <li>Do not post spam and affiliate links, offensive posts, posts without content, or flames.</li>
                            <li>Do not recommend specific webhosts, nor post links to webhost recommendation sites.</li>
                            <li>Do not post in all caps.</li>
                            <li>Do not ask for help regarding premium themes/plugins.</li>
                            <li>Avoid asking questions that are more about opinion, like “recommending web hosting providers” or other “discussion topics”, that may lead to pointless wars and/or attract spam replies.</li>
                            <li>Do not abuse the @&lt;name&gt; mentions, they are not a tool to get faster responses.</li>
                            <li>Do not disregard/ignore direct communication from forum moderators.</li>
                            <li>Do not seek legal advice on the forums</li>
                            <li>Do not threaten lawsuits or any other legal action on the forums.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Please note that this list is not exhaustive. Every post is judged on its own merits.</p>

                        <p>And that’s all. Enjoy your stay at the forums! Oh.. And, when you’re done, please mark your topic as “Resolved”. Thanks.
                        </p>
